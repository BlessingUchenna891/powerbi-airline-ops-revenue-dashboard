# powerbi-airline-ops-revenue-dashboard

**Project Overview**

This Power BI solution was developed as a comprehensive case study to address the challenge of quantifying the operational and financial impact of flight delays within the airline industry. The project links key performance indicators (KPIs) like promptness and resource consumption directly to revenue performance.

**Key Objectives**
Diagnosis: Accurately identify the specific root causes of flight delays (e.g., Operational, Technical, Weather).
Tracking: Monitor the critical trend of On-Time Rate over time to assess management intervention effectiveness.
Impact Analysis: Determine which high-revenue flight routes are most severely impacted by delays, enabling data-driven risk management.

**Technical Solution & Dashboard Pages**
The solution is structured across multiple linked pages to provide a seamless analytical workflow:

**a.** **Executive Overview Dasboards (Page 1 & 2):** They collectively present a logical flow of information for a senior leader. They effectively separate the Performance Status (Page 1) from the Revenue and Failure Breakdown (Page 2).
Here is a breakdown of what each page entails:

 **1.** **Executive Overview (Page 1).**
 **Focus: Performance Status, Trend, and Financial Volume:** This page is designed to give the executive an immediate answer to three questions: What is our current status? Is it getting better or worse? Where is the money coming from?
