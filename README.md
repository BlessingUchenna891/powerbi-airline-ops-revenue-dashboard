# powerbi-airline-ops-revenue-dashboard

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This Power BI solution was developed as a comprehensive case study to address the challenge of quantifying the operational and financial impact of flight delays within the airline industry. The project links key performance indicators (KPIs) like promptness and resource consumption directly to revenue performance.

**KEY OBJECTIVES**
Diagnosis: Accurately identify the specific root causes of flight delays (e.g., Operational, Technical, Weather).
Tracking: Monitor the critical trend of On-Time Rate over time to assess management intervention effectiveness.
Impact Analysis: Determine which high-revenue flight routes are most severely impacted by delays, enabling data-driven risk management.

**TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS AND DASHBOARD PAGES**
The solution is structured across multiple linked pages to provide a seamless analytical workflow:

**Operations Performance (Executive View):** Focuses on high-impact KPIs (e.g., 15% On-Time Rate, 25.38 AVG Delay mins) and uses a stacked bar chart to instantly diagnose Operational issues as the dominant cause of delays.

**Revenue Performance (Page 3):** Links operational metrics to financial results. Key features include tracking Total Revenue, AVG Revenue, and Fuel Used. The page features a critical visual showing AVG Delay (mins) by Route, highlighting high-delay routes that threaten revenue streams (e.g., Abuja-Lagos).

**Detailed Analysis (Operations Performance 3 (Page 6)):** Provides transactional tables with conditional formatting to allow users to drill down to individual flight performance, revenue groups, and delay severity levels.

**SKILLS DEMONSTRATED**
**Power BI Desktop:** End-to-end report design and development.

**Data Modeling & DAX:** Creation of a robust model, including necessary time intelligence columns and calculated measures (e.g., On-Time Rate, Delay Status, Delay Category, Revenue Group etc.).

**Visualization:** Advanced use of Dual-Axis Charts (Line/Column), Waterfall Charts, and effective use of color and conditional formatting for business impact.

**Data Storytelling:** Designing a logical report flow from high-level summary $\rightarrow$ root cause analysis $\rightarrow$ financial consequence.
